channel-tree.js: chatzilla plugin to list tabs in a treeview

The plugin displays open "tabs" in a treeview, which can replace the tab bar.
you can click on the tree items to switch the current view, and if you use the
tab bar to switch view, the selected item in the tree is updated. You can right
click tree cells to access the same context menu as tab context menu. Tree labels
can change color to indicate the view status, customizable through CSS.

Check the github repository for updates:

TODO

- Add menu entry to hide/show the tree, or adjust its location
- Use tree-utils instead of DOM tree

BUGS

- If the plugin is manually loaded after some views are open, styles on treecells
  are not applied except when they are hovered, or when the view state gets changed
  again. This situation disappears if the tree is redrawn such as when the window
  is resized to make the tree smaller
- Moving the userlist with the plugin enabled does not work as intended. ChatZilla
  might become unusable or the move does not happen
- Width of treeview is not persisted
- Treeitems at top level are displayed as having children even if they don't
