channel-tree.js: chatzilla plugin to list tabs in a treeview

The plugin displays open "tabs" in a treeview, which can replace the tab bar.
you can click on the tree items to switch the current view, and if you use the
tab bar to switch view, the selected item in the tree is updated. You can right
click tree cells to access the same context menu as tab context menu. Tree labels
can change color to indicate the view status, customizable through CSS.

Check the github repository for updates:

PREFERENCES

- showIcons: if "true" (default), icons are shown before labels in the tree to
  indicate the type of view (network, channel, user etc).

- treeAtLeft: if "true" (default), the channel tree is shown on the left side of
  the window. If "false", on the right.

TODO

- Use tree-utils instead of DOM tree
- Sort tree items by view type
- Allow tree items for hidden views be styled

BUGS

- Width of treeview is not persisted
- Treeitems at top level are displayed as having children even if they don't
